# Tributes to Jean Wheatley

## Son
You raised me kindly into the man I am today.

Through the good, bad and ugly times, you loved and supported me.

When I acheived, you proudly celebrated success with me.

When I erred, you councilled me without judgement. 

And whenever I asked, you always gave what I **needed**.

~~It was a privilege to give help whenever you needed it.~~

You were a conscientious friend and a willing volunteer, giving your time generously.
