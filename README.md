## Tributes from her family and friends

Thank you Mum for raising me _kindly_ into the man I am today.
Through the good, bad and ugly times, you loved and supported me. When I achieved, you proudly celebrated my success; when I erred, your council came without judgement. 
You gave all that I _needed_ and it was a privilege to help you in return.

You were a conscientious and faithful friend, a willing volunteer who gave your time generously and with enthusiasm. You had a passion for singing in the Long Eaton U3A Choir and had a _sweet voice_ according to your friend and neighbour Jean Gunell.
