# Tributes

>Thank you Mum for raising me _kindly_ into the man I am today.
Through good, bad and ugly times, you loved and supported me. When I achieved, you proudly celebrated my success and when I erred, your council was without judgement. 
You gave all that I _needed_ and it was my privilege to help you in return.

>You were a conscientious and faithful friend, a willing volunteer who gave your time generously and with enthusiasm. You greatly enjoyed singing and added your _sweet_ voice to the Long Eaton U3A Singers group.

>Jean and I were united in a common love - Richard. We were united in the good times - Richard achieving a first at University, getting married and the joy of children/grandchildren. We were united in the hard times - some of you will recall January 2014.

>I admired Jeans resilience and drive, both in her working life and when she restired. I will miss her.
