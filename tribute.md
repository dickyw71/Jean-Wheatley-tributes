# Our tribute to Jean Wheatley

## Son
You raised me kindly into the man I am today.

Through the good, bad and ugly times, you loved and supported me.

When I acheived success, you proudly celebrated with me.

When I made mistakes, you helped me without judgement. 

And whenever I asked, you always listened and gave what I **needed**.

~~It was a privilege to give help whenever you needed it.~~

A concientous friend and a willing voluntier, giving your time
