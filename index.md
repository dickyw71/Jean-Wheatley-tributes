# Personal tributes to Jean Wheatley

You raised me kindly into the man I am today.
Through the good, bad and ugly times, you loved and supported me. When I acheived, you proudly celebrated my success; when I erred, your council came without judgement. 
When asked, you gave all that I **_'needed'_** and it was a privilege help you in return.

You were a conscientious and faithful friend, a willing volunteer who gave your time generously and with enthusiasm. You had a passion for singing in a choir and had a sweet voice according to your friend Jean Gunell.
