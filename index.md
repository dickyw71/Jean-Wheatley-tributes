# Personal tributes to Jean Wheatley

You raised me kindly into the man I am today.

Through the good, bad and ugly times, you loved and supported me.

When I acheived, you proudly celebrated success with me; when I erred, your council came without judgement. 

When I asked, you gave all I **needed**; it was my privilege help you in return.

You were a conscientious and faithful friend; a willing volunteer, giving time generously and with enthusiasm. 

You had a passion for singing with a choir and had a sweet voice.
